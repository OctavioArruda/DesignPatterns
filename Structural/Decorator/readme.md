- Related to the __Open-Close Principle__

## About the Decorator

- Uses composition instead of inheretance(always choose composition instead of inheretance)
- Similar to the __Composite Pattern__
- The purpose is to add funcitonality to objects in __execution time__
- Pretend to be the object being decorated, but redirect method calls  to the object itself
